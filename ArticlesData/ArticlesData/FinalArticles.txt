new hitch drop in sales of its two established products the model sedan and model sport utility vehicle the company is counting on the success of the new offering the model to increase revenue and help pare its losses as tesla invests heavily in the vehicles it hopes to offer in the future but series of setbacks have left tesla far behind schedule in turning out the model for which nearly prospective buyers have already put down deposits and it is taking some extraordinary measures to turn things around mr musk said on twitter this week that he had been sleeping at the plant and the

churn out mr musk once envisioned producing as many as cars this year and last summer he was hoping to be able to make model month by december more recently tesla had aimed to produce at least model per week by the end of the first quarter but that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter and it has produced fewer than in the first quarter the company said tuesday there have been signs of momentum however in the past seven days tesla said it had produced model rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week in filing with the securities and exchange commission tesla

bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn as straightforward as it could appear for example modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified or can alter the car driving characteristics if you make change to solve one problem you can create five other problems he said people think you just find problem and solve it but it not like that there are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers working in teams either at the car company or the suppliers to deal with while tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the model in the first quarter deliveries of the model and model declined by percent from the previous quarter to even as the company reported the most productive quarter in tesla history tesla said it had been hurt by shortage of battery packs for its cars made at the plant it calls the gigafactory near reno nev michelle krebs senior analyst at autotrader com said the decline in deliveries of the model and model might suggest that the allure of tesla vehicles has somewhat faded electric cars make up fewer than percent of all vehicles sold in the united states you just wonder

lane the driver laid on his horn and had to grab control to avoid an accident blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue the tesla owner manual describes this situation as one that the system can yet manage tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem but for now drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car tesla had no comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer advertisement   the   at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances rather than supplants the driving experience tempted to join the model waiting list which numbers over customers investors too seem to have reassessed tesla recent bad news this week

than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting

trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls

works fine until it suddenly doesn on saturday tesla declined to comment on the california crash or to make mr musk or another executive available for an interview in its blog post on friday about the crash the company acknowledged that autopilot does not prevent all accidents but said the system makes them much less likely to occur and unequivocally makes the world safer for the company the significance of the crash goes beyond autopilot tesla is already reeling from barrage of negative news the value of its stock and bonds has plunged amid increasing concerns about how much cash it is

yet manage tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem but for now drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car tesla had no comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer advertisement   the   at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances

investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation

turismo to miles per hour in seconds it will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear wheel steering that will help it in the corners at feet long the

bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn as straightforward as it could appear for example modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified or can alter the car driving characteristics if you make change to solve one problem you can create five other problems he said people think you just find problem and solve it but it not like that there

comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer advertisement   the   at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances rather than supplants the driving experience tempted to join the model waiting list which numbers over customers investors too seem to have reassessed tesla recent bad news this week

require other parts to be modified or can alter the car driving characteristics if you make change to solve one problem you can create five other problems he said people think you just find problem

negative publicity it seems clear that tesla will rise or fall based on the performance safety design and value of its cars if it gets those things right all the other issues will sort themselves out tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics that includes the model which popular mechanics named its car of the year it was finalist for motor trend similar award that it lost out to the alfa romeo giulia has drawn howls of online protest when my model test vehicle pulled up to the curb on eighth avenue it didn quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull wing doors on the model had but could see why the automotive press is so excited the interior features single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by touch screen interface that houses nearly all the controls many of them voice activated with its zen minimalism it doesn look or feel like any other car ve been in the synthetic leather seats are comfortable and there ample room for someone my size foot this all comes at cost for this luxurious long range version far from the base price that has excited many potential tesla buyers the model may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the but found it nimble and responsive easily accelerated from full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed usually nerve racking maneuver in conventional car driving the model was such pleasure was reluctant to cede any control to autopilot for someone with decades of experience driving conventional car my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as shock the sensation of vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that instinctively gripped the steering wheel which immediately transferred control back to me this time was more relaxed willing to see how the car would behave gave the voice activated navigation system destination garden state plaza new jersey shopping mall about miles away and the car accelerated braked stayed in the center of the lane and maintained comfortable three car distance ahead of me all without my intervention at the mall it detected an empty parking place and flawlessly backed into it one of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn signal lever the tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane waits for an opening and then glides into place eliminating the danger of blind spot over the years ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots although been briefed on its limitations so successful was autopilot that was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror that would have been mistake for all its vision capabilities including in darkness autopilot became confused when lanes weren clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps you can simply program the destination and let the car find its way it reassuringly cautious about changing lanes but in heavy traffic would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find suitable opening and had to assert manual control while heading south on the new jersey turnpike could see in the rearview mirror bmw bearing down at high speed pushed the turn signal for lane change and despite its ultrasonic sensors the tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car it started to move into its lane the driver laid on his horn and had to grab control to avoid an accident blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue the tesla owner manual describes this situation as one that the system can yet manage tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem but for now drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car tesla had no comment for this column at this juncture autopilot is misnomer as many others have observed this is not self driving technology said bryan reimer research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the massachusetts institute of technology it collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers hands and isn intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years mr reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future self driving automation systems are ranked from zero no automation to full automation tesla autopilot is level it requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel the car issues prompt if it doesn detect hand on the wheel and autopilot shuts down if there no response in the mountain view accident tesla has said the driver received several visual and one audible hands on warning but the driver hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision given that this was my first extended drive using autopilot was hypervigilant maybe even more so than in conventional car told that wears off in time as using autopilot becomes second nature the risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention mr reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue as technology supplants human performance mr reimer said the bigger question is how safe is safe enough if lane changing technology is percent more effective than humans is that good enough that the big question no one wants to answer at the same time he said he worries that intense media coverage of accidents like mountain view will scare people off he said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality but noted that tesla excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using autopilot can be substantially more risky than conventional controls there were more than traffic fatalities in the united states last year after investigating fatal crash involving tesla and tractor trailer in florida the national highway transportation safety administration found no flaws in the autopilot system the national transportation safety board concluded that autopilot had performed as intended but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology after my drive in the model my sense is that even with its flaws tesla autopilot is vast improvement over conventional controls and enhances rather than supplants the driving experience tempted to join the model waiting list which numbers over customers

elon musk the chief executive on tuesday that will make him nearly billion if he hits new targets by that on top of the billion gain the electric car pioneer would make on his existing stake mr musk new targets are even more ambitious than the year goals from that he blew through years early the potential value of share grants totaling percent of the company is vast but at least the tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting serious challenge it involves mr musk hitting two sets of metrics first tesla market capitalization has to reach billion more than times its current level and valuation that would be fourth among today publicly listed companies behind apple alphabet and microsoft and just ahead of amazon second he must turbocharge tesla financial performance that requires either growing annual revenue to billion almost times expected top line or making billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization figure that may come in at just over million for last year there are steps along the route to the maximum payout reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over million of tesla current and planned vehicles breakingviews calculates that level of sales would be in the same ballpark as bmw and last year total for tesla was barely over vehicles that doesn allow for any surge in the company solar panel and electric storage business which at present contributes single digit percentage to the top line still to get close would require tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as general motors nissan and others ramp up their efforts one model for musk could be amazon whose billion of expected revenue would mark fold increase from founder jeff bezos stock has surged to times its value decade

the model then in he said ll have to see you know how things are going at that point adding will certainly be the for the next four or five years and it after that with the success of mr musk various other endeavors such as space his aeronautics company it was only natural that investors would expect that the model for robert downey jr tony stark character in iron man might move on to different role at tesla well it is now four years later the model had its debut last july though production delays have slowed the rollout and mr musk to be determined declaration has been determined he told me he had agreed to stay on as chief executive at tesla for the next decade advertisement   the   the company is planning to announce on tuesday mr musk new compensation plan and it is perhaps the most radical in corporate history mr musk will be paid only if he reaches series of jaw dropping milestones based on the company market value and operations otherwise he will be paid nothing   the   advertisement   the   tesla has set dozen targets each billion more than the next starting at billion then billion then billion and so on all the way to market value of billion in addition the company has set dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals mr musk would receive million shares or about percent of the company only after he reaches milestones for both but to put these numbers in perspective tesla is worth only about billion today if mr musk were somehow to increase the value of tesla to billion figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make tesla one of the five largest companies in the united states based on current valuations his stock award could be worth as much as billion assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade which is unrealistic even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions mr musk critics and there are many are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company latest publicity stunt he has been called modern day barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates the company continues to lose money at one point last year it was losing almost half million dollars an hour according to bloomberg news jim chanos short seller who has bet against tesla shares and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade has contended that tesla is worthless but mr musk compensation plan is no illusion he gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap and it impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for temporary period under the terms of the arrangement even once his shares vest he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them the way the arrangement is structured each milestone is blunt instrument he either reaches it or gets nothing if all that happens over the next years is that tesla value grows by or percent then my amount of compensation would be zero he said his calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about billion still he

committee told me it heads you win tails you don lose meaning if mr musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning too and if mr musk does not perform shareholders pay nothing mr musk new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth billion in only now the numbers are much larger that package also paid mr musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks and virtually nobody could imagine tesla would be worth times what it was back then mr musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan even though mr musk shares have vested he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants his current stake is worth billion mr musk does not take salary although under california state law tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage tesla sends him checks that pay him little more than annually don cash it he said it just ends up accumulating in tesla bank account somewhere to afford to live mr musk has borrowed against his shares practice that some corporate executives have questioned mr musk insists that the loans are such small portion of his stake in the company that even if tesla shares were to fall precipitously it would not impact him or the company if mr musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks it would also mean that the company employees including those who work on the factory floor who get paid in both cash and stock could become wealthy under the terms of the deal which is subject to shareholder approval mr musk has to remain the company chief executive though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with chief executive reporting to him he said he saw that as possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit top person to oversee the operations mr musk has often said he is not driven by money so what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him none of it is intended for dynastic

astronomical bills for the state million residents the high capacity tesla battery does not create energy it just stores it the state already invests in wind and solar energy the battery would give it

speech at the university of california berkeley pieter abbeel played video clip of robot doing housework in the clip recorded in the robot swept the floor dusted the cabinets and unloaded the dishwasher at the end of it all it even opened beer and handed it to guy on couch the trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar dictating its every move but as mr abbeel explained the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior it just needed software that could guide the hardware without the help of that engineer this is largely computer science problem an artificial intelligence problem mr abbeel said we have the hardware that can do the job advertisement   the   mr abbeel native of belgium has spent the last several years working on artificial intelligence first as berkeley professor and then as researcher at openai the lab founded by tesla chief executive elon musk and other big silicon valley names now he and three

firm amplify partners and other investors the company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own using these methods existing robots could learn to for example install car parts that aren quite like the parts they have installed in the past sort through bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at warehouse or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not   the   advertisement   the   we now have teachable robots mr abbeel said during recent interview at the new company offices in emeryville calif just across the bay from san francisco the new company is part of much wider effort to create that allows robots to learn researchers in places like google brown university and carnegie mellon are doing similar work as are existing start ups like micropsi and prowler io robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses such as moving boxes from place to place at amazon massive distribution centers but companies must program these machines for each particular task limiting their possible applications the hope is that robots can master much wider array of tasks by learning on their own today every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter said sunil dhaliwal the amplify founder who led the firm investment in embodied intelligence but most real problems can be solved that way you have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do but to tell it how to learn photo tianhao zhang using virtual reality tools to show robot how to perform task credit amy harrity for the   mr abbeel and the other founders of embodied intelligence including the former openai researchers peter chen and rocky duan and the former microsoft researcher tianhao zhang specialize in an algorithmic method called reinforcement learning way for machines to learn tasks by extreme trial and error researchers at deepmind the london based lab owned by google used this method to build machine that could play the ancient game of go better than any human in essence the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself over and over and over again advertisement   the   other researchers across both industry and academia have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well by repeatedly trying to open door for instance robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which don much like google and labs at brown and northeastern university embodied intelligence is also augmenting these methods with wide range of other machine learning techniques most notably the start up is exploring what is called imitation learning way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations the company is using this method to teach two armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from table donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands mr abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in digital world that recreates what is in front of robot then the machine can then learn from this digital data photo peter chen diagramming some of the start up underlying technology credit amy harrity for the   we collect data on what the human is doing mr chen said then we can train the machine to imitate the human these and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics it is telling that openai pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits poached away from openai by mr musk himself the machine learning expert andrej karpathy is now the director of at tesla working to help
